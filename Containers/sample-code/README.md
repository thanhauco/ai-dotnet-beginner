# Sample Code for the .NET Containers Beginners Series

This folder contains sample materials for the .NET Containers Beginners Series videos.
The `container-webapp` folder holds a .NET WebAPI application, generated by the following .NET CLI command:

```console
$ dotnet new web -n container-webapp
```

When watching the videos, you can either use this sample code as provided, or follow along yourself by
running the same command in your terminal. If you do, you should see output like this:

```console
# dotnet new web -n container-webapp
The template "ASP.NET Core Empty" was created successfully.
