## Video 2 : How to Install .NET MAUI on a PC

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James talks to us about what is needed to get started building apps with .NET MAUI with Visual Studio 2022 and a PC. He explores how you install the .NET MAUI workload, how to create a new project, and what else is included such as the Android SDK manager and Emulator manager.

## Video 3 : .NET MAUI Architecture Overview

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James walks through getting started with your first app and talks through all of the different components of how a .NET MAUI application is structured, how it features cross-platform resources including fonts, images, and assets, and talks about how to configure the app and how it starts up. He then shows off how to create your first project from Visual Studio, deploy it on to different platforms and many of the tools included such as XAML and C# hot reload.

## Video 4 : Build .NET MAUI UI with XAML

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James shows how to start to build user interfaces for .NET MAUI with XAML, and xml based mark up language. He walks through building a full task application user interface with data entry, buttons, lists of data, and even swipe to delete all with XAML hot reload.

## Video 5 : .NET MAUI Data Binding with MVVM & XAML

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James introduces us to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern that separates your user interface from your code. It also unlocks the ability to use data binding, which is the glue between the view and viewmodel that makes the UI responsive when properties change and vise vera! In this video we take the UI that we built with XAML and make it functional with MVVM and the .NET Community Toolkit which streamlines development.

## Video 6 : Navigating Between Pages in .NET MAUI

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James shows off how to use the built-in navigation system of .NET MAUI to easily navigate between pages of the application with a URL based schema, and how to pass full objects as well.

## Video 7 : Accessing Platform Features in .NET MAUI

Welcome to the .NET MAUI for Beginners Series where you will learn the basics of building multi-platform apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows from a shared C# code base. In this video, James shows off how .NET MAUI enables developers to easily access platform APIs through C#. He also walks through using one of the many cross-platform APIs to access these features that .NET MAUI includes such as the Connectivity API. He shows how to access the APIs, use dependency injection, and check for internet in a single line of code.
