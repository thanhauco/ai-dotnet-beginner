      "3. Esopus Creek Conservancy - This is an easy 1.5-mile hike in Saugerties, NY that takes you through forests, fields, and streams. The preserve has several trails to explore, and the views of the Esopus Creek are stunning. Fun fact: The Esopus Creek is a popular spot for trout fishing, and you might even catch a glimpse of a bald eagle flying overhead!\n",
